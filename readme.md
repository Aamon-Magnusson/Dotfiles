# Aamon Dotfiles

This is here to let me easily get my customization back on a new install. I don't have any program installs, to keep it distro agnostic.

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/Aamon-Magnusson/DotFiles
cd DotFiles
./setup.sh
```

Any Desktop related files will be in the respective WM's git repo currently [DWM](https://github.com/Aamon-Magnusson/AamonDwm).

## Fetch?

The fetch script I have is so that if I make changes to any local files I can pull them into the repo.

Both that and the `setup.sh` is very poorly written, I'll make it better one day

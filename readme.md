# Aamon Dotfiles

This is here to let me easily get my customization back on a new install. I don't have any program installs, to keep it distro agnostic.

## Commands

```
cp vimrc ~/.vimrc
cp bashrc ~/.bashrc
cp alacritty ~/.config/
```

Any Desktop related files will be in the respective WM's git repo currently including [DWM](https://github.com/Aamon-Magnusson/AamonDwm), [Awesome](https://github.com/Aamon-Magnusson/AwesomeAamon), and [Qtile](https://github.com/Aamon-Magnusson/AamonQtile).

It's not like these dotfiles plus a Desktop Environment will fill up an Arch install, cause I haven't done that yet.

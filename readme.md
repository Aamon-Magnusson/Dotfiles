# Aamon Dotfiles

This is here to let me easily get my customization back on a new install.

## Nice configs

Some of my configs I am somewhat proud of such as:

- nvim ( [init.vim](nvim/init.vim) )
- fish ( [config.fish](config.fish) )
- (hopefully more to come)

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/Aamon-Magnusson/DotFiles
cd DotFiles
./setup.sh
```

Any Desktop related files will be in the respective WM's git repo currently [DWM](https://github.com/Aamon-Magnusson/AamonDwm).

## Fetch?

The fetch script I have is so that if I make changes to any local files I can pull them into the repo.

Both that and the `setup.sh` is very poorly written, I'll make it better one day
